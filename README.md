# python-matrix
It's not exactly the matrix rain effect but this is basically an infinite loop that prints out a bunch of ones and zeros in green. 

You can also resize the window while it's running and it will adjust.

This works with python 2 && 3.

The program was developed and tested in Ubuntu 15. No guarantees for any other os
